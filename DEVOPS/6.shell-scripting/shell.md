1. **Kernel** : This is the heart of the OS as it is responsible for communicating with different software and doing the tasks.

    There are four important aspects of the kernel:

    - Device management
    - Memory management
    - Process management
    - Handling your system calls

2. **System Libraries** : They are responsible for performing a particular task. 
    
    Example: `libC`

**Not going into the details of it but these are the fundamentals of the OS.**

### 4. `df -h`
