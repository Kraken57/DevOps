### **What is DevOps?**

- So basically its about `Automation`, `Improving Delivery`, `Quality`, `Monitoring` and `Testing`.

### **Why DevOps?**

Imagine you're working at a company, and you need to deliver an application to a customer. In simple terms, the goal is to move the application from a developer's laptop to production *(where the customer can use it).*

About 10 years ago, this process was much more complicated. Several roles were involved:

- ***System Administrators*** set up servers for testing because testing on personal laptops wasn’t possible *(platforms like AWS didn’t exist yet, so they used tools like VMware and OpenStack).*
- ***Build and Release Engineers*** deployed the application onto the servers.
- ***Server Administrators*** created the app servers to host the application.

This whole process used to take a long time, sometimes around 10 days. To speed things up, we needed to automate these manual tasks—and that’s where **DevOps** came in.
