# Software Development Life Cycle with Devops

### **SDLC :**
#### *A standard followed in every Organization or Software Industry to `Design`, `Develop`, and `Test` inorder to delivery a high quality product.*

*For Example :*

> <span style="color:lightblue">Let's say you are working at `example.com` which is a ecommerce website. So here at `example.com` we delivery a ecommerce application. So before this product is been ready for publication there are different phase at `example.com` which are: 
1. <span style="color: lightgreen">Planning <span />
2. <span style="color: lightgreen">Defining <span />
3. <span style="color: lightgreen">Designing <span />
4. <span style="color: lightgreen">Building <span />
5. <span style="color: lightgreen">Testing <span />
6. <span style="color: lightgreen">Deploying <span />

The above things is a cyclic process.

1. <spam style="color: orange">**Planning** :
This is the initial stage where the scope, requirements, and objectives of the project are defined. Teams gather to understand customer needs, market trends, and set the goals for the project.

2. <spam style="color: pink">**Defining** :
Once the planning is complete, the requirements are clearly documented. This phase ensures everyone is on the same page about what the product will deliver. It typically involves writing detailed specifications and setting milestones.

3. <spam style="color: lightblue">**Designing** :
Based on the defined requirements, the architecture and technical design of the application are created. This phase involves UI/UX design, system architecture, and how different components of the system will interact with each other.

4. <spam style="color: lightgreen">**Building** :
This is where the actual development begins. The engineers write the code, develop features, and integrate them into the broader system. Teams collaborate to build a working version of the application.

5. <spam style="color: yellow">**Testing** :
Once the application is built, it is tested to ensure it meets the quality standards. This includes unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, and more, to make sure there are no bugs and the application behaves as expected.

6. <spam style="color: lightpink">**Deploying** :
Finally, the application is deployed to the production environment. This involves making the application available for users by deploying it on servers, managing configurations, and ensuring a seamless release.


## The Role of DevOps
The traditional way of working often led to inefficiencies, especially when different teams (development, operations, etc.) were siloed. DevOps bridges this gap by automating and streamlining many of the above phases.

Here's how DevOps comes into the picture:

- Automated Build and Deployment (CI/CD): DevOps practices ensure the continuous integration (CI) of code changes and the continuous delivery (CD) of new features. Automated pipelines can handle building, testing, and deploying the code to production faster and with fewer errors.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): During the design and deployment phases, DevOps allows infrastructure to be treated as code. Tools like Terraform or Ansible are used to automate the provisioning of servers, networks, and other resources.

- Monitoring and Feedback: DevOps involves continuous monitoring of the application post-deployment, ensuring any bugs or issues in production are quickly identified and resolved, and feedback loops drive improvements in the planning phase.

- Collaboration and Automation: By breaking down the silos between developers, operations, and other teams, DevOps fosters collaboration and relies on automation to handle repetitive tasks, ensuring the process is not just faster but also more reliable.

In conclusion, DevOps helps streamline the entire process from Building to Deploying, with continuous testing and feedback throughout the lifecycle. This shortens the development cycle, reduces manual effort, and ensures faster delivery of quality products to the customer.
